## Project Overview
As a **Data Analyst** with experience at **KloudOpp Limited**, I specialize in transforming raw data into **actionable business insights**. In this project, I demonstrated a full data workflow:
- **Data cleaning & transformation** using **Python (Pandas)**
- **Dashboard development** in **Microsoft Excel** (PivotTables, charts, KPIs)
- **Strategic insights** for sales, marketing, and operations teams
  
This project identifies profit leaks, top performers, and growth opportunities just like real-world stakeholder reporting.

## Dataset
- **Source**: [Superstore Sales Dataset (Kaggle)](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/vivek468/superstore-dataset-final)
- **Cleaning Process**:
  - Cleaned and standardized 9,995 sales records.
  - Converted `Order Date` and `Ship Date` to datetime.
  - Created `Profit Margin` = Profit / Sales.
  - Categorized discounts into bands: Low (≤10%), Medium (10-20%), High (>20%).
  - Handled missing values and ensured data integrity.
- **Output**: `cleaned_superstore.csv`

## Tools & Skills Used
- **Python**: Pandas for data cleaning and preprocessing.
- **Excel**: PivotTables, charts, conditional formatting, dashboard design.
- **Data Analysis**: Trend analysis, profitability, discount impact.
- **Business Intelligence**: Translating data into strategic insights for non-technical stakeholders.

## Dashboard Preview

*Interactive Excel dashboard showing sales by region, monthly trends, and profit analysis.*

## Key Insights
1. **Technology Drives Revenue** The Technology category generated $836K in sales (36.4% of total): the highest of any category.
2. **High Discounts Hurt Profitability** Orders with discounts >20% lost $97.18 on average per order: making them unprofitable.
3. **West Region Leads in Sales & Profit** The West region generated $725K in sales and $108K in profit: the highest of any region.
4. **November 2017 Was the Peak Month** November 2017 had $118K in sales: a 49% increase from 2016.
5. **Top Product: Canon imageCLASS 2200 Copier** This product generated $25.2K in profit: more than the next two combined.
6. **Steady Growth in 2017** Sales in August, October, and November 2017 showed significant growth.
7. **Balanced Product Portfolio** All three categories contribute roughly one-third of total sales: a healthy mix.

These insights mirror real-world impact I delivered at **KloudOpp**, where strategic analysis improved marketing efficiency by **15%** and enabled new business lines.
